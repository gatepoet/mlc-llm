Welcome to MLC-LLM's documentation!
===================================

MLC LLM is a **universal solution** that allows **any language models** to be **deployed natively** on a diverse set of hardware backends and native applications, plus a **productive framework** for everyone to further optimize model performance for their own use cases.

Our mission is to **enable everyone to develop, optimize and deploy AI models natively on everyone's devices**.

Everything runs locally  with no server support and accelerated with local GPUs on your phone and laptops.
